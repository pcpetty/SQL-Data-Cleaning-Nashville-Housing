# SQL Data Cleaning: Nashville Housing Portfolio Project

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset related to housing in Nashville using SQL. The data cleaning process addresses issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and data formatting, making the dataset suitable for further analysis and visualization.

## Project Objectives
- Clean and standardize the Nashville housing dataset.
- Address data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on various housing attributes in Nashville, including property details, sales history, and geographic data.

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Replacing or removing null values in critical columns.
2. **Standardizing Data Formats:** Ensuring consistent date formats and numeric data types.
3. **Removing Duplicates:** Identifying and removing duplicate records.
4. **Addressing Inconsistencies:** Correcting errors and ensuring data integrity.
5. **Data Transformation:** Renaming columns, creating new features, and restructuring the dataset.

## Key SQL Queries
- **Missing Values:** `SELECT * FROM housing_data WHERE column_name IS NULL;`
- **Duplicate Removal:** `DELETE FROM housing_data WHERE rowid NOT IN (SELECT MIN(rowid) FROM housing_data GROUP BY column1, column2);`
- **Data Transformation:** `UPDATE housing_data SET column_name = REPLACE(column_name, 'old_value', 'new_value');`

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database Management System (DBMS):** SQLite/PostgreSQL (specify based on what you used)
- **SQL:** Used for data cleaning and transformation

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SQL-Data-Cleaning-Nashville-Housing.git
